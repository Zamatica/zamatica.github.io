		<h2>About Leibering Dimension, Inc.</h2>
        <hr class="title" align="left">
			<p>For three generations in Indiana, the Leibering Family has been devoted to the timber industry. From the timber harvesting and tree planting 
            operations, to the high production band sawmill and dimension products facility, an attitude of stewardship and responsibility to the forest and to the environment 
            is evident in every aspect of our business.</p>
            
			<p>At Leibering Dimension our focus is to exceed each customers individual needs by providing them with superior products and service every time,
