						Our Sustainability
					</h3>

					<hr align="left" class="title">

					<p>
					</p>

					<p>
						Leibering Dimension takes standing lumber and converts the raw materials to the saw mill, where it is dried and
						processed into its final dimension. Unique in the industry, Leibering is one of the few companies taking product
						from harvest to completion. We think you'll find Leibering Dimension easy to work with and a high-quality on-time
						supplier!
					</p>

					<p>
						For three generations in Indiana, the Leibering Family has been devoted to the timber industry. From the timber
						harvesting and tree planting operations, to the high production band sawmill and dimension products facility, an
						attitude of stewardship and responsibility to the forest and to the environment is evident in every aspect of our
						business.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Forest Stewardship Council has awarded us the Chain-of-Custody Certificate which allows us to certify
						products have been harvested from forests that meet stringent environmental, social and economic standards.
					</p>

					<hr class="base">

					<p>
						At Leibering Dimension our focus is to exceed each customers individual needs by providing them with superior
						products and service every time, wholly supported by our parent company Leibering Lumber.
					</p>

					<p>
						From the rough lumber production to finished dimension products, our success is attributed to our great people
						and the ability to control the production process from start to finish. This complete attention to detail is at
						the heart of everything we do and everything we are.
					</p>

					<p>
						Leibering Dimension, Inc. was established in 2008 with one goal in mind:<br>
						<br>
						<strong>To consistently provide our customers with high quality dimension products.</strong>
